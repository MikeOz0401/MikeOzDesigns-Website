                    <p class="about-content-text">
                        Hi, I am Mike! I am a passionate architectural designer who has always dreamed of shaping every aspect of an architectural project, such as designing interiors, exteriors or gardens.
                        Nothing makes me happier than sitting down with people, discussing their ideas, and translating them into spaces they can truly enjoy living in. 
                        Helping people turn their visions into reality is truly why I love to do this.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Academically, I hold a MEng degree in Civil Engineering with Architecture from the University of Glasgow; from which I graduated in 2024. 
                        However, my journey started in Glasgow Kelvin College, where I initially developed a passion for tackling & solving tough structural engineering problems.
                        During my time here I was able to excel academically, achieving top grades in my class, which was quickly followed by my transition to university to continue pursuing a career in the Civil sector of Engineering.
                        However, the transition was not simple, as I knew that despite having a passion for solving structural problems ... 
                        I also really enjoyed tackling the design aspect of those same projects; often finding myself doodling façade designs, structural connection details, garden layouts, residential houses, flats, modern villas and more.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It was at that point I knew that pursuing just one aspect of the industry would not be enough for me. 
                        Luckily for me, I did not have to choose, as I was offered a place at the University of Glasgow which offered a course in both Civil Engineering, as well as Architecture, which was exclusively taught by licensed Architects at the Glasgow School of Art.
                        It was easy to say that this course proved to be perfect for me. Here, I was able to fully develop my understanding of the complex theories surrounding structural engineering, 
                        as well as my skills and abilities at crafting architectural designs from the idea conception stage, all the way to the final renditions.
                        This unique combination of disciplines empowers me to approach designs from a unique angle, as I am not only able to bring your most complex visions and ideas to life, 
                        but I am also able to ensure they are practical and realistic.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Professionally, I balance my roles as a Graduate Structural Engineer at Jacobs, with my position as a Lead Designer at MikeOzDesigns. 
                        Through these roles I can continue developing my structural engineering knowledge; by working towards my CEng as a structural engineer, in addition to further developing my creative skills by pursuing project on the side when given the opportunity.
                        Commitment to innovation and excellence drives me to continuously seek opportunities that blend my technical expertise with my creative aspirations, enhancing the built environment in meaningful ways.

                                Pursuing this degree allowed me to merge my passions for structural integrity and creative design. 
                                At these institutions, I excelled academically, being selected for the Engineering Excellence list whilst consistently achieving A grades in Architecture modules. 
                                This interdisciplinary approach emphasised the integration of structural engineering principles into architectural projects, enabling me to create solutions that are both innovative and practical. 
                                This dual expertise ensures my designs are aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust, a balance highly valued by clients and engineering professionals alike.

                                My journey here began as a passion project during my university years. 
                                What started as a platform to showcase my academic work and personal projects that I worked on during my free time, naturally evolved into MikeOzDesigns in October 2022.

                                In this position, I assess and design both refurbishments of existing bridge structures as well as participate in new-build projects, contributing to the enhancements of vital infrastructure. 
                                Additionally, I collaborate with experienced engineers to implement innovative solutions.

                                    As part of my MEng programme, this design project let me showcase the architectural and engineering knowledge I’ve gained over the years comes together in practice. 
                                    My goal was to produce a comprehensive proposal that satisfied every structural and spatial requirement in the given brief. 
                                    To do so, I tackled the challenges of designing a multi-storey building in an urban setting, whilst developing a rich mix of spaces that could become new homes for several works from the Burrell Collection.

                                    This project was my very first real life project, which focused around a major re-design of almost all spaces in the dwelling. 
                                    The client has purchased the house, but they were not very satisfied with how the overall circulation worked in the house. 
                                    The dwelling did go through a renovation back in the 1990's, although it was restricted by financial availability, which led to the placement of the staircase in a very awkward position. This placement did not fully utilise all the possible available space in the dwelling.

                                    <br>

                                    This project focused on tackling these issues, transforming an unused room into a bathroom, whilst simultaneously creating a more private master bedroom. 
                                    The proposal also focused on designing the garden area and by bringing a double driveway space on the overgrown land space, whilst still maintaining a large area of greenery, to maintain the cozy vibe the property had to offer.

                                    This project involved creating a detached garage, situated in the rear curtilage of the site, which would act as a storage and working area for the client that was in the construction business. 
                                    However, as the client did not require anything big, the design was restricted to the rules set out in the Permitted Development guide as well as Regulation 5 of Schedule 3 in the Building Regulations. 
                                    This saved a lot of time and money for the client, allowing them to begin construction a lot faster.

                                    This was a project I done with my colleague from University; Charles Kinnon. 
                                    It focused on creating a dwelling in a small plot of land, whilst also allowing for good amounts of natural light to travel into both properties.

                                   This project was done as part of my 3rd Year portfolio. It was done in collaboration with my university colleague Charles Kinnon. 
                                   It focused on transforming an old library into a more modern space, filled with new spaces that the people living in Bo'Ness could use.

                    <p class="service-description">
                        Looking to make some changes around your home? Are you considering adding an extension, converting a loft into a room, transforming your old spare room into a bathroom or maybe re-arranging your garden layout? 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I can help design, visualise, draft and submit your plans to your local council for approval. As part of my standard service, I include visualisations for all my projects during this process. This means that throughout the design phase, I'll create 3D visualisations of the designed spaces or proposed changes, helping you see the results before they're a reality. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, I'll also keep you informed of the entire process in detail, ensuring everything is clear and that you feel comfortable throughout.

                    <p class="service-description">
                        Alongside a Planning application, a Building Warrant will most likely also be required to obtain permission from your local council; which is a <u><b>legal requirement</b></u> prior to beginning any construction project. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        While I'm currently unable to sign off on SER certificates, my experience in structural engineering enables me to draft designs that take into account the structural side of things. This means that my solutions will most likely not change majorly after a review from a structural engineer.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Additionally, to make the process less stressful for you, I can contact and work with other structural engineers to draft a proper building warrant application on your behalf, ensuring the application process goes smoothly.

                        Not looking for any big changes? Are you just planning on building a garage or swimming pool in your garden, transforming your living room into an open plan living space, redesigning your bedroom to an office space or any other small work that you can complete yourself or with your local joiner?
                         <br> 
                        <br>
                        Your proposal may fall under <b>Permitted Development</b>, which does not require a <b>Building Warrant</b> or <b>Planning Permission</b> from your local council, if designed to the rules and regulations.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Should this be the case, I can help draft, design and bring your idea to reality, helping you save money along the way & enable you to start the construction process much faster than you would usually be able to.

                            Hiring Mike was the smartest decision we made for our renovation. From the first sketch to the final council approval, they translated our vague ideas into elegant, buildable plans and guided us through every step. 
                            The 3-D visuals helped us see the space before construction began, and the finished result looks exactly as promised—only better. 
                            Professional, creative, and relentlessly organised.
